<p>The first animation film I ever saw as a youngling. I was a year old when the film came out, and I think I saw it when I was around four or five. A classic Pixar film.</p>

<h3>The Avengers</h3>

<p>A fantastic superhero film. I saw it in theatres with some friends. I was a junior in high school.</p>

<h3>Her</h3>

<p>An unorthodox love story. I adore the awkwardness, and how the plot turns out. The plot goes in some different directions a traditional love plot goes and undermines the typical tropes.</p>
